## Route map

 - Spatial autocorrelation and model performance
 - Model selection
 - Multiple variables
 - Reconstruction diagnostics
 - Climate reconstruction in a perfect model world

 
## Spatial autocorrelation

Microfossil assemblages and environmental conditions at adjacent sites are more similar than expected by chance  

- lack of independence of observations
- violates basic assumption of most statistical methods
- model performance is over-optimistic  
- reconstruction uncertainty is underestimated
- can result in spurious reconstructions

## Spatial autocorrelation solutions
 
 - avoid sensitive methods (especially MAT) 
 - h-block cross-validation
 - model-based solution


## _h_-block cross-validation

Omit samples from within h-km of target sample during cross-validation

 ```{r hblock, out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("https://quantpalaeo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/hblock-1.png")
```
 
## Determining _h_

 ```{r hblock2, out.width=800}
knitr::include_graphics("https://quantpalaeo.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/hblock-6.png")
```


<div class = "notes">
 - NB k-fold cross-validation is NOT a solution
</div>

## Method selection 

Deshrinking 

```{r deshrinking, echo = FALSE, results = "hide", fig.width = 5,fig.height = 5, message = FALSE}
library(rioja)
data(SWAP)
mod <- crossval(WA(SWAP$spec, SWAP$pH))
plot(mod, xval = TRUE, xlab = "Measured pH", ylab = "Reconstructed pH", add.smooth = TRUE)

```

##

- WA with monotonic deshrinking typically beats other WA-based methods
- WA inappropriate if taxa have multimodal distributions

MAT often appears to have better performance than WA 

 - often spurious, driven by autocorrelation
 
Bayesian methods very promising


## Variable selection

- Importance in the calibration set does not mean variable is ecologically important down-core

- Reconstruction significance tests can help

## Reconstruction diagnostics{.columns-2}

 ```{r reconDiag, out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics(" https://quantpalaeo.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/analoguechunk-1.png")
```
 
 - Distance to nearest analogue
 - Residual distance
 - Reconstruction significance tests
 

## Reconstructions in a perfect model world

Test transfer functions methods on a Holocene vegetation-climate simulation
 
 - 6000 year ECHAM5/MPIOM simulation
 - JSBACH vegetation module

```


## Protocol

```


## Simulated and reconstructed climate

```


## Correlations between warmest and coolest seasons

```{r rehfeld4, out.width=1000}

```

## Conclusions

- Be careful
- Be critical
